# Personal stuff, hobbies, passions, and things

<hr aria-hidden="true" />

## Accessibility

I’m passionate about accessibility in software because everyone deserves to be able to use technology, no matter what. I believe great design should be intuitive and inclusive, ensuring people of all abilities can engage with it easily. Accessibility isn’t just a feature—it’s a core part of creating user-friendly software that empowers everyone.

## Amateur photography

I figured out that I often neglect to take photos with my phone. Once I decided to start bringing a dedicated camera I take more shots and enjoy taking photos a whole lot more.

## Design

Design is more than a profession for me—it’s a passion that spans everything from interiors to city planning, architecture, and software. I’m especially drawn to the elegance of minimalism, where every element serves a purpose, creating spaces and systems that feel intentional and uncluttered. Inclusivity is a core value in my work, ensuring that the environments and interfaces I help create are accessible and meaningful to all. Whether it’s shaping a physical space or developing a digital platform, I’m excited by the challenge of making design that’s simple, intuitive, and beautiful.

## Earth

My passion for the Earth drives everything I do, from embracing sustainable technologies to reimagining how we live. I’m especially excited about the potential of IoT to create smarter, more efficient systems that reduce waste and conserve resources. Solar energy is another area where innovation excites me—it’s clean, abundant, and capable of powering our future in harmony with the planet. When combined with modern city planning, these technologies offer a path to greener, smarter cities that work in sync with the environment, improving lives while protecting our Earth for generations to come.

## Eva & Wally

I have two cats, Eva and Wally. They are both rescues and were born at some random point in 2023. I love them to death and don't know what I would do without all the chaos they add to life.
