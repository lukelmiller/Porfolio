# Personal stuff and things

## Eva & Wally

I have two cats, Eva and Wally. They are both rescues and were born at some random point in 2023 (we don't know really). They love chasing, playing, and man do they love eating more than anything else (fair).

## Hobbies

### Amateur photography

I figured out that I often don't take photos with my phone. I do when I carry a camera so I've dived deep into photography.

#### My cameras

-   GoPro Hero 7 Silver (Action)
-   Nikon a50 (DSLR)
-   Polaroid Now Gen 2 (Instant)

### Lego

I've always loved Legos, they scratched an itch that's more physical than a puzzle and just as fun.
